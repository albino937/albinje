### Hey <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampavangandhi/iampavangandhi/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="25px">
My name is Albin Joseph, I am a doctoral candidate working on observational cosmology at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/). My work focuses on understanding the nature of [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy) which is responsible for the present accelerated expansion of our universe. My research areas include observational constraints on the dark energy models, exact solutions of cosmological models and applying machine learning techniques in the cosmological scenarios. I enjoy physics, coding in different languages and GPU computing. Other than that, I love adventure and also a passionate badminton player.

### Some of my favourite tools
